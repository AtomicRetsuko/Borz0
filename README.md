# Borz0 1.2.0 ETL Pipeline

This is an ETL Project I made for school.
It consist of a Jupyter Notebook in Python, using Spark for the Data,
it also contain 3 csv files containing the data on 3 different things :
- Dogs
- Real Estate
- Bank Client Datas

## Features

The Project is an ETL for it :

- Extract Data From the csv file of your choice just put it in the same folder as the .ipynb first
- Transform Data by sorting your file datas by a parameter of your choice
- Load sorted Data into a new file that you name

## Nota Bene

I tried to comment every aspect of the code to make it really readable and easy to understand.
If you have any tips, fell free to send me a message.
